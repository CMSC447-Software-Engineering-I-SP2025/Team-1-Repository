# Boulder Buddy

This is a web application designed for Climbers.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your computer.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your computer. You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

Install a C#/.NET IDE of choice like [Visual Studio Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) (free by default) or [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) (only free if you apply for a free [student license](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students)).

If using Visual Studio, open the Visual Studio Installer application, click the "Modify" button for Visual Studio Community 2022, and install the "ASP.NET and web development" workload if it is not already installed.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository

2. Navigate to the Frontend Directory:

   ```sh
   cd Frontend
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

## Starting the application

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the Frontend Directory:

   ```sh
   cd Frontend
   ```

2. Start the development server:

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` on a browser to see the website running.

### Backend

1. Open the `BoulderBuddyAPI.sln` file in the `/Backend/BoulderBuddyAPI/` directory using your .NET IDE of choice.

2. Run the program using your IDE (Main function is in Program.cs).

3. The API listens for requests on `http://localhost:5091` and `https://localhost:7195`

7. The Swagger developer webpage (GUI view) for the API is available at `https://localhost:7195/swagger/index.html` on a browser.

## Creating code coverage reports for backend unit tests

### Prerequisite tooling

With the project open in Visual Studio, enter the "View" menu on the top of the window, then click "Terminal" (or use Ctrl+\`). Enter this command into the console: `dotnet tool install -g dotnet-reportgenerator-globaltool`

### Generating code coverage reports

1. Navigate to the `/Backend/BoulderBuddyAPI.Tests/` directory in the Visual Studio developer terminal (opening terminal is described above)

2. Enter the following command to run unit tests and generate a machine-readable .xml code coverage report. Take note of the "attachments" that are logged to the console when you run this command. <br>
`dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"`

3. Enter the following command to generate a human-readable .html code coverage report. The `{guid}` field in the below command must be changed to the randomized subdirectory name generated by the previous command (visible in the "attachments" output in console). <br>
`reportgenerator -reports:"TestResults\{guid}\coverage.cobertura.xml" -targetdir:"coveragereport" -reporttypes:Html`

4. In your File Explorer or Visual Studio, locate the file `/Backend/BoulderBuddyAPI.Tests/coveragereport/index.html` and open it in your browser of choice.
